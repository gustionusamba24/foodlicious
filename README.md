## Before You Start

Before you run this project, make sure you have already create account for Spoonacular API. Open [https://spoonacular.com/](https://spoonacular.com/). Once you have already created account, you can get an API Key. You will need to add the API Key to your `.env` file which is stored into a variable.\
Don't worry, I have added `.env.example` file as an example how to save an API Key.\
